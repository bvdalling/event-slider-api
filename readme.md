This is an event-slider control API using websockets. It's not very secure. It's meant to be put onto a domain the day of the event and taken down the day after. Contestants should NOT know where the event-slider is hosted. Even if they're contributing to it. The event-slider-api (this repo) uses the origin and an API-Key to reduce the liklihood of defacement during the event. This doesn't eliminate the risk. Sufficiently motivated and technical individuals can attack the network to find the domain and control plane. Then look through packets to determine how to authenticate. Contestants should not be able to see this API at any time for any reason.
